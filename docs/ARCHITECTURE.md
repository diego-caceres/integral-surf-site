# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Integral Surf Site is built using Next.js 15 with the App Router architecture, providing a modern, performant, and SEO-friendly web application. This document outlines the key architectural decisions and patterns used in the project.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. App Router Architecture

- Using Next.js App Router for improved performance and SEO
- Route groups (e.g., `(auth)`, `(marketing)`) for better organization
- Server Components by default, with Client Components when needed
- Layout-based architecture for consistent UI across routes

### 2. Component Architecture

- Atomic Design principles for component organization
- Server Components as the default choice
- Client Components only when necessary (interactivity, browser APIs)
- Component composition over inheritance
- Props interfaces for type safety

### 3. State Management

- React Server Components for server-side state
- React Context for global client-side state
- Local component state for UI-specific state
- Supabase for persistent data storage

### 4. Data Flow

- Server Components fetch data directly
- Client Components use custom hooks for data fetching
- API routes for server-side operations
- Supabase client for database operations

### 5. Authentication

- Supabase Auth for authentication
- Protected routes using middleware
- Role-based access control
- Session management with cookies

### 6. Styling Strategy

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Design tokens for consistency
- Responsive design patterns

### 7. Performance Considerations

- Server Components for reduced client-side JavaScript
- Image optimization with next/image
- Font optimization with next/font
- Route prefetching
- Static and dynamic rendering strategies

### 8. API Integration

- Supabase for backend services
- RESTful API routes for custom endpoints
- Type-safe API calls
- Error handling patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**

   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use meaningful file and directory names
   - Follow consistent naming conventions
   - Group related functionality

2. **Type Safety**

   - Use TypeScript for all new code
   - Define interfaces for props and data
   - Avoid using `any` type
   - Use strict type checking

3. **Performance**

   - Implement proper loading states
   - Use proper caching strategies
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Monitor bundle sizes

4. **Security**
   - Validate all user input
   - Implement proper authentication checks
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Follow security best practices

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**

   - Plan for increased traffic
   - Consider microservices if needed
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Monitor performance metrics

2. **Maintenance**

   - Regular dependency updates
   - Code quality monitoring
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security audits

3. **Features**
   - Internationalization support
   - Advanced analytics
   - Enhanced SEO features
   - Progressive Web App capabilities
